# decision-tree
### First experiment:
Training and Testing with Fixed Train-Test Split Ratio:
<ul>

<li>Divide the dataset into a training set and a testing set (30% of the samples).</li>
<li>Repeat this experiment five times with different random splits of the data into training 
and test sets.</li>
<li>Report the sizes and accuracies of the decision trees in each experiment, Compare the 
results of different models and select the one that achieves the highest overall 
performance</li>
</ul>
